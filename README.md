# Volumetric AR Display

This repo contains code (simulation, decomposition algorithms, GPU, arduino) for the volumetric AR display described in the paper *Rathinavel, K., Wang, H., Blate, A., & Fuchs, H. (2018). An extended depth-at-field volumetric near-eye augmented reality display. IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics*.

It also contains additional code (adaptive decomposition algorithms) descibed in my PhD thesis *Rathinavel, K., 2020. Volumetric and Varifocal-Occlusion Augmented Reality Displays (Doctoral dissertation, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).*
